/*3.    A do while loop is executed: 
        a. At least once. 
        b. At least twice. 
        c. At most once. 

Solution: is option (a) In this loop, the body executes first, and then the 
                        condition is checked.

This means:
    Even if the condition is false on the first check, the body still runs one time.
So, the loop always executes at least once, no matter what the condition is.*/
